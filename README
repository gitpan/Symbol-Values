DESCRIPTION

This module provides consistent accessing interface to values of symbol.

Below is the background why I wore this module.

I've been feeling that glob notation of perl is little bit funny.

First problem is that it lacks consistency in the way of 
fetching/storing values of a symbol.

See examples below.

  $code_ref = *name{CODE};    # Getting code object.
                              # This is obvious.
  
  *name{CODE} = $code_ref;    # Setting code object.
                              # THIS CODE DOES NOT WORK!!
  
  
  *name = $code_ref;          # This code works...
                              # Isn't it funny?

Second problem is readability of the code.

I think that inconsistency of the glob notation is making
readability of the code little bit difficult.

Therefore I wrote this module to provide alternative way of accessing
to the values of a symbol.

By using this module, above examples can be wrote as below.

  use Symbol::Values;
  my $sym = Symbol::Values->new('name');
  
  $code_ref = $sym->code;    # Getting code object.
  
  $sym->code = $code_ref;    # Setting code object.

I hope this module makes your code more readable.
