DESCRIPTION
    This module provides consistent accessing interface to values of symbol.
    
    Below is the background why I wore this module.
    
    I've been feeling that glob notation of perl is little bit funny.
    
    First problem is that it lacks consistency in the way of 
    fetching/storing values of a symbol.
    
    See examples below.
    
      $code_ref = *name{CODE};    # Getting code object.
                                  # This is obvious.
      
      *name{CODE} = $code_ref;    # Setting code object.
                                  # THIS CODE DOES NOT WORK!!
      
      
      *name = $code_ref;          # This code works...
                                  # Isn't it funny?
    
    Second problem is readability of the code.
    
    I think that inconsistency of the glob notation is making
    readability of the code little bit difficult.
    
    Therefore I wrote this module to provide alternative way of accessing
    to the values of a symbol.
    
    By using this module, above examples can be wrote as below.
    
      use Symbol::Values;
      my $sym = Symbol::Values->new('name');
      
      $code_ref = $sym->code;    # Getting code object.
      
      $sym->code = $code_ref;    # Setting code object.
    
    I hope this module makes your code more readable.
